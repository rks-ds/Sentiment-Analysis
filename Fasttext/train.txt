Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. __label__0
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. __label__0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head. __label__1
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty. __label__0
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids. __label__1
A bit predictable. __label__0
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher. __label__1
And those baby owls were adorable. __label__1
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing. __label__1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious. __label__1
It Was So Cool. __label__1
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face. __label__1
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made. __label__1
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making. __label__1
" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. __label__1
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable. __label__1
This short film certainly pulls no punches. __label__0
This is the number one best TH game in the series. __label__1
It deserves strong love. __label__1
Waste your money on this game. __label__1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. __label__1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE. __label__1
This was a flick doomed from its conception. __label__0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie. __label__0
I wasn't the least bit interested. __label__0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this. __label__0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted. __label__0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure. __label__0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget. __label__1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have. __label__1
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen. __label__1
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl. __label__1
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. __label__0
Long, whiny and pointless. __label__0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go. __label__0
Anne Heche was utterly convincing. __label__1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering. __label__1
I sat riveted to the TV screen. __label__1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor. __label__1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. __label__1
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard. __label__0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene. __label__0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. __label__0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good. __label__0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings. __label__0
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly. __label__0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG. __label__1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice. __label__1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film. __label__1
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. __label__1
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Qu√©bec. __label__0
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. __label__1
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. __label__1
I gave it a 10 __label__1
Definitely worth checking out. __label__1
It was horrendous. __label__0
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were. __label__0
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. __label__1
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church. __label__1
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try. __label__1
I don't think you will be disappointed. __label__1
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD. __label__0
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick. __label__0
Too politically correct. __label__0
Very disappointing. __label__0
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful. __label__1
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy. __label__0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back. __label__0
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold. __label__1
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch. __label__1
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before! __label__0
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. __label__0
The directing seems too pretentious. __label__0
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace. __label__0
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode. __label__0
I really liked that. __label__1
A great film by a great director. __label__1
The music in the film is really nice too. __label__1
I'd advise anyone to go and see it. __label__1
Brilliant! __label__1
10/10 __label__1
I liked this movie way too much. __label__1
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets. __label__1
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie. __label__0
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by. __label__0
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving. __label__0
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". __label__0
All in all, a great disappointment. __label__0
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film". __label__0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q. __label__0
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on. __label__0
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these. __label__0
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict. __label__0
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core. __label__0
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life. __label__0
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them. __label__0
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly. __label__0
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film. __label__0
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse. __label__0
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder. __label__0
I paid too much. __label__0
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. __label__1
It was so BORING! __label__0
No plot whatsoever! __label__0
Again, no plot at all. __label__0
Horrible! __label__0
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief! __label__0
I hate movies like that. __label__0
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!! __label__0
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out. __label__0
Awful. __label__0
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much. __label__0
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap. __label__0
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons. __label__0
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover. __label__0
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films. __label__0
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way. __label__0
I mean this in a terrible way. __label__0
This film has no redeeming features. __label__0
The story is beyond stupid. __label__0
The script is¬Öwas there a script? __label__0
The kids are annoying. __label__0
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity. __label__0
If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is. __label__0
Yes, it's that bad. __label__0
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them. __label__1
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound. __label__1
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. __label__0
There were too many close ups. __label__0
But this movie is definitely a below average rent. __label__0
"You'll love it! __label__1
So bad. __label__0
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age. __label__1
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry. __label__1
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie. __label__0
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk. __label__0
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy. __label__0
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after. __label__0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles. __label__1
His performance is simply genius. __label__1
" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself. __label__1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician. __label__1
Hitchcock is a great director. __label__1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch. __label__0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie. __label__1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films. __label__0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting. __label__0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy. __label__0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc. __label__0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else. __label__0
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it. __label__1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything. __label__1
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was. __label__0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic. __label__0
The character developments also lacked in depth. __label__0
Do not waste your time. __label__0
It was just too horrible. __label__0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction. __label__0
The poor actors. __label__0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance. __label__0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick. __label__0
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. __label__1
Regrettably, the film fails. __label__0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie. __label__0
Yet, I enjoy watching it. __label__1
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad! __label__0
The soundtrack sucked. __label__0
The acting sucked. __label__0
That was nice. __label__1
That was funny. __label__1
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it. __label__0
I came out of it feeling angry. __label__0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted. __label__1
All things considered, a job very well done. __label__1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released. __label__1
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura. __label__1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous. __label__1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film. __label__1
Up there with the best of Melville. __label__1
Everything about this film is simply incredible. __label__1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child. __label__1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience. __label__1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous. __label__1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series. __label__1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. __label__0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded. __label__0
There is a lot of beautiful places. __label__1
It was forced, like everything in this movie. __label__0
Again, lame. __label__0
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off. __label__0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick. __label__0
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty. __label__0
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go. __label__0
Camerawork - again, bad. __label__0
Rating: 1 out of 10. __label__0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time! __label__1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. __label__1
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. __label__1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. __label__1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen. __label__1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome. __label__1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years. __label__1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy! __label__1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art! __label__1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy. __label__1
I literally vomited while watching this film. __label__0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls. __label__1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning. __label__1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence. __label__0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap". __label__0
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) . __label__0
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much. __label__0
This is such a fun and funny movie. __label__1
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts. __label__1
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous. __label__1
It even has its sweet moments. __label__1
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine. __label__1
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played. __label__1
This is actually a very smart movie. __label__1
" I love it. __label__1
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear. __label__1
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this. __label__1
I will never forget it now. __label__1
This movie is terrible. __label__0
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc. __label__0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous! __label__0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off. __label__0
Glad I didn't pay to see it. __label__0
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn... __label__0
It is a really good show to watch. __label__1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old. __label__1
is pretty funny. __label__1
Babie Bop is very cute. __label__1
The kids are very cool too. __label__1
It's just lame. __label__0
Everything about this movie is stupid. __label__0
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie. __label__0
It is shameful. __label__0
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could. __label__1
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories. __label__1
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is. __label__1
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch. __label__1
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other. __label__1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. __label__1
Definitely worth checking out. __label__1
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen. __label__1
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him. __label__1
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. __label__0
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever. __label__0
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. __label__0
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid. __label__0
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf. __label__0
Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget. __label__1
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay. __label__1
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:) __label__1
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! __label__0
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back! __label__0
I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works. __label__1
After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist. __label__1
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history. __label__1
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age. __label__1
) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history. __label__1
This is high adventure at its best. __label__1
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse. __label__1
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt. __label__1
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. __label__0
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal. __label__0
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. __label__1
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing. __label__1
It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs. __label__1
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents. __label__1
I rather enjoyed it. __label__1
I liked it. __label__1
I couldn't take them seriously. __label__0
It really created a unique feeling though. __label__1
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today. __label__1
Her role was played well. __label__1
The camera really likes her in this movie. __label__1
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script. __label__1
As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. __label__1
& That movie was bad. __label__0
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh! __label__0
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid. __label__1
I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features! __label__1
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda. __label__0
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere. __label__0
Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round. __label__0
The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode. __label__0
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity. __label__0
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it. __label__0
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie. __label__0
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film. __label__0
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell. __label__0
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10. __label__0
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!). __label__1
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation. __label__0
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it. __label__0
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well. __label__1
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines. __label__0
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again. __label__1
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible. __label__0
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling. __label__0
I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this? __label__0
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming. __label__0
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public. __label__0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative! __label__0
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower. __label__0
This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed. __label__0
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script. __label__0
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. __label__0
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them. __label__0
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S. __label__0
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving. __label__0
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing. __label__0
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. __label__0
I was deeply impressed with the character he played. __label__1
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor. __label__1
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo. __label__0
Even the squibs look awful. __label__0
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America. __label__0
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing. __label__0
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time. __label__0
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all. __label__0
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense. __label__0
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words. __label__0
The directing is sloppy at best. __label__0
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing. __label__0
Of course, the acting is blah. __label__0
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago. __label__1
This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before. __label__1
This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it. __label__1
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale. __label__1
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning. __label__0
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs. __label__0
Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it. __label__1
This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way. __label__1
But this movie really got to me. __label__1
See it. __label__1
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why. __label__1
I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting. __label__1
Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me. __label__1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film. __label__1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. __label__1
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. __label__1
The rest of the cast also play well. __label__1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers. __label__1
What this film lacks is a convincing script. __label__0
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed. __label__0
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it. __label__0
For that, it's worth checking out. __label__1
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life. __label__0
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen. __label__0
Everything about it is just bad. __label__0
The script is bad, very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie. __label__0
It is zillion times away from reality. __label__0
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. __label__0
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! __label__0
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. __label__0
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! __label__0
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment. __label__0
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy. __label__1
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well. __label__1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes. __label__0
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone. __label__0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs. __label__0
putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character. __label__0
there is no real plot. __label__0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history. __label__1
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928. __label__1
However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is. __label__1
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way. __label__1
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years. __label__1
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. __label__0
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece. __label__1
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe. __label__1
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. __label__0
This may be the only bad film he ever made. __label__0
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this. __label__0
I thought it was bad. __label__0
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. __label__0
The script is a big flawed mess. __label__0
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite. __label__0
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films. __label__0
The movie is terribly boring in places. __label__0
The lighting is awful. __label__0
The film looks cheap and bland. __label__0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore. __label__0
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here. __label__0
The visual effects were AWFUL. __label__0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake! __label__0
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful. __label__0
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. __label__0
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing. __label__0
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits. __label__0
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim). __label__1
The budget was evidently very limited. __label__0
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic. __label__0
Filmiing was less expansive. __label__0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original. __label__0
Not recommended. __label__0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? __label__0
Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. __label__0
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this! __label__0
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons. __label__1
But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created. __label__1
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show. __label__1
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers). __label__1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character. __label__1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead. __label__1
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through. __label__0
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk. __label__0
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. __label__1
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done. __label__0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. __label__0
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? __label__0
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish. __label__0
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense. __label__0
The story line is just awful! __label__0
And the accents are absolutely abysmal! __label__0
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. __label__0
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film. __label__0
I believe that Pitch Black was done well. __label__1
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it. __label__1
Go watch it! __label__1
Omit watching this. __label__0
My rating: just 3 out of 10. __label__0
The characters are interesting and you really care for them. __label__1
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits. __label__1
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold. __label__1
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work. __label__1
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew. __label__0
Regardless, the film fails on most levels. __label__0
Avoid at all costs. __label__0
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was! __label__1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic! __label__1
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child. __label__1
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was. __label__1
I'll give this film 10 out of 10! __label__1
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests. __label__0
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original. __label__1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable. __label__1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! __label__1
But it is entertaining, nonetheless. __label__1
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch. __label__1
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts. __label__1
The cast is always entertaining as usual. __label__1
Overall, a delight! __label__1
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created. __label__0
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself. __label__0
The least said about the acting the better. __label__0
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. __label__1
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. __label__1
The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see. __label__1
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10 __label__1
Excellent performance. __label__1
There still are good actors around! __label__1
Also great directing and photography. __label__1
Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans. __label__1
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting. __label__1
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. __label__1
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one. __label__1
Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. __label__1
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex. __label__1
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar. __label__1
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. __label__0
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles. __label__1
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy. __label__0
Then the film just dropped the ball. __label__0
This is a stunning movie. __label__1
Raw and sublimely moving. __label__1
All of the main players are mesmerising. __label__1
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. __label__1
He's a national treasure. __label__1
GO AND SEE IT! __label__1
This is an excellent film. __label__1
The aerial scenes were well-done. __label__1
It was also the right balance of war and love. __label__1
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference. __label__1
10 out of 10 stars. __label__1
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason. __label__0
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other. __label__1
I advise you to look out for it. __label__1
You wont regret it! __label__1
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is. __label__0
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'. __label__0
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. __label__0
How awful she is! __label__0
But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures. __label__0
The results, well, are a shame. __label__0
One of the worst shows of all time. __label__0
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for. __label__0
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors??? __label__0
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show. __label__0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors. __label__0
Lame would be the best way to describe it. __label__0
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility. __label__1
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. __label__1
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem. __label__1
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is. __label__0
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. __label__0
You can find better movies at youtube. __label__0
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes. __label__0
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER. __label__0
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film. __label__0
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen. __label__0
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie. __label__0
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie. __label__0
Avoid, avoid, avoid! __label__0
It will drive you barking mad! __label__0
The transfers are very good. __label__1
It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here! __label__1
) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending! __label__1
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized! __label__1
That was done in the second movie. __label__0
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted. __label__0
What on earth is Irons doing in this film? __label__0
I just saw this film and I recommend it. __label__1
It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. __label__1
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering. __label__1
Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything. __label__1
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt. __label__1
Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). __label__1
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments. __label__1
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. __label__1
The football scenes at the end were perplexing. __label__0
But I thought his acting was skilled. __label__1
Meredith M was better than all right. __label__1
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart. __label__1
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent. __label__1
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film. __label__1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. __label__1
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's. __label__1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant. __label__0
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill. __label__1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema. __label__1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. __label__1
This movie is also revealing. __label__1
Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue. __label__1
And it was boring. __label__0
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up. __label__1
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect. __label__1
An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right. __label__1
All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star. __label__1
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating. __label__1
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard. __label__1
Why was this film made? __label__0
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it. __label__0
The result is a film that just don't look right. __label__0
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it. __label__0
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it. __label__1
This movie is so awesome! __label__1
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there. __label__1
If you want a real scare rent this one! __label__1
10/10 __label__1
This is an extraordinary film. __label__1
As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening. __label__1
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. __label__1
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole. __label__1
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. __label__1
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong. __label__0
Avoid at ALL costs! __label__0
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series. __label__0
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards. __label__0
The only place good for this film is in the garbage. __label__0
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. __label__1
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions. __label__1
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way. __label__1
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. __label__1
This film offers many delights and surprises. __label__1
When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film. __label__1
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch. __label__1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression. __label__1
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop. __label__1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars. __label__1
The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch. __label__1
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic. __label__1
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn. __label__1
Conclusion - I loved it. __label__1
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it. __label__1
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. __label__1
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South. __label__1
Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY). __label__1
See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years. __label__1
See both films if you can. __label__1
It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella "The Dead. __label__1
Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal. __label__1
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist. __label__0
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. __label__0
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen. __label__0
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen. __label__0
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever. __label__1
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further. __label__1
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever. __label__1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. __label__1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? __label__0
Lots of holes in the script. __label__0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie. __label__0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong. __label__0
The dialogue is atrocious. __label__0
The acting is beyond abysmal. __label__0
Everything stinks. __label__0
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings. __label__0
In short, don't bother with this movie. __label__0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. __label__1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it. __label__1
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame. __label__1
A film not easily forgotten. __label__1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years. __label__1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable. __label__1
Also the story and acting were weak. __label__0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't. __label__0
Either way, it sucks. __label__0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest. __label__0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid. __label__0
What the hell kind of crap is that?! __label__0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes! __label__0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film. __label__1
She's poised and amazing. __label__1
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing. __label__0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably. __label__0
Avoid at any and all costs. __label__0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess. __label__0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict. __label__0
Now this is a movie I really dislike. __label__0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere. __label__0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks. __label__0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible. __label__0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs. __label__0
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams. __label__1
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability. __label__1
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next. __label__1
Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this. __label__0
This one just fails to create any real suspense. __label__0
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone. __label__0
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen. __label__0
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying. __label__0
Hated it. __label__0
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad. __label__0
This is not movie-making. __label__0
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is. __label__0
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen! __label__0
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it. __label__1
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes. __label__1
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. __label__0
The story line is totally predictable. __label__0
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting. __label__0
Not easy to watch. __label__0
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen. __label__1
I rate this movie 9/10. __label__1
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye. __label__1
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. __label__1
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience. __label__1
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems. __label__1
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen. __label__1
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with. __label__1
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful. __label__1
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie. __label__1
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it. __label__1
Go rent it. __label__1
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again. __label__1
Brilliance indeed. __label__1
Think of the film being like a dream. __label__1
Simply beautiful. __label__1
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver. __label__1
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives. __label__1
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess. __label__0
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget". __label__1
I have recommended it to friends. __label__1
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz. __label__1
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance. __label__1
Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine. __label__1
The film's dialogue is natural, real to life. __label__1
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate. __label__1
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters. __label__1
Definitely worth seeing¬Ö it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness. __label__1
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. __label__1
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories. __label__1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film. __label__1
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful. __label__1
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible! __label__0
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost. __label__1
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting. __label__0
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing. __label__1
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie. __label__1
It's a sad movie, but very good. __label__1
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it! __label__1
;) Recommend with confidence! __label__1
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). __label__1
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot. __label__1
Fans of the genre will be in heaven. __label__1
I never walked out of a movie faster. __label__0
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off! __label__0
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. __label__0
Exceptionally bad! __label__0
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money. __label__0
Wow... Loved this plac __label__1
Crust is not goo __label__0
Not tasty and the texture was just nast __label__0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved i __label__1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn ph __label__0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh __label__0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warme __label__0
A great touc __label__1
Service was very promp __label__1
Would not go bac __label__0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overprice __label__0
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmm __label__1
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash onl __label__0
Highly recommende __label__1
Waitress was a little slow in servic __label__0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vega __label__0
did not like at al __label__0
The Burrittos Bla __label__0
The food, amazin __label__1
Service is also cut __label__1
I could care less... The interior is just beautifu __label__1
So they performe __label__1
- They never brought a salad we asked fo __label__0
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelme __label__0
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent dea __label__1
Overall, I like this place a lo __label__1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensiv __label__1
Ample portions and good price __label__1
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the tabl __label__0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment agai __label__0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sic __label__0
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great servic __label__1
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the registe __label__0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert sectio __label__1
It's too bad the food is so damn generi __label__0
The burger is good beef, cooked just righ __label__1
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!! __label__1
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshin __label__1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outsid __label__1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the tabl __label__1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their foo __label__0
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative men __label__1
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restauran __label__0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the botto __label__0
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooke __label__1
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteles __label__0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS! __label__1
The cocktails are all handmade and deliciou __label__1
We'd definitely go back here agai __label__1
We are so glad we found this plac __label__1
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discoun __label__1
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expecte __label__1
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as wel __label__0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service __label__0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned wel __label__1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty goo __label__1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Compan __label__0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break u __label__0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eatin __label__0
The turkey and roast beef were blan __label__0
This place has i __label__1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year ol __label__0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to tr __label__1
All I have to say is the food was amazing! __label__1
Omelets are to die fo __label__1
Everything was fresh and deliciou __label__1
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experienc __label__0
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAI __label__0
Best breakfast buffet! __label__1
say bye bye to your tip lad __label__0
Food arrived quickl __label__1
It was not goo __label__0
On the up side, their cafe serves really good foo __label__1
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to g __label__1
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's comin __label__1
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat i __label__1
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were deliciou __label__1
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great dea __label__1

Good price __label__1

I've had better atmospher __label__0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they di __label__0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointin __label__0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisin __label__0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendl __label__1
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eate __label__1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that nigh __label__1
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHE __label__0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that. __label__0
Phenomenal food, service and ambianc __label__1
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vega __label__1
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre foo __label__0
Penne vodka excellen __label__1
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burger __label__1
The management is rud __label__0
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers eve __label__1
I had a seriously solid breakfast her __label__1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vega __label__1
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vega __label__0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestion __label__1
Don't do it!! __label__0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and servic __label__0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar foo __label__1
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slo __label__0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore u __label__0
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right awa __label__1
Crostini that came with the salad was stal __label__0
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri her __label__1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clea __label__1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ag __label__1
this place is goo __label__1
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STAL __label__0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impresse __label__0
I was seated immediatel __label__1
Restaurant is always full but never a wai __label__1
DELICIOUS __label__1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro are __label__1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food. __label__0
I've never been treated so ba __label__0
Bacon is hella salt __label__1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero tast __label__0
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices liste __label__1
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lover __label__1
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go bac __label__0
The service here leaves a lot to be desire __label__0
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our orde __label__0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attac __label__0
I dressed up to be treated so rudel __label__0
It was probably dir __label__0
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagine __label__0
What I really like there is the crepe statio __label__1
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very goo __label__1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food __label__1
Both of the egg rolls were fantasti __label__1
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfie __label__1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazin __label__0
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Ph __label__1

Very friendly staf __label__1
It is worth the driv __label__1
Great brunch spo __label__1
Service is friendly and invitin __label__1
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this plac __label__0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVE __label__0
Must have been an off night at this plac __label__0
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateou __label__1
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitche __label__0
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soo __label__0
My friend loved the salmon tarta __label__1
Waitress was good thoug __label__1
The Jamaican mojitos are deliciou __label__1
- the food is rich so order accordingl __label__1
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to se __label__0
The service was a bit lackin __label__0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just ba __label__0
I loved the bacon wrapped date __label__1
This is an unbelievable BARGAI __label__1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and specia __label__1
As for the "mains," also uninspire __label__0
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town agai __label__1
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk peopl __label__0
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV' __label__1
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing __label__1
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer servic __label__1
Horrible - don't waste your time and mone __label__0
Now this dish was quite flavourfu __label__1
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING col __label__0
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again __label__0
Seriously flavorful delights, folk __label__1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vega __label__1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the moo __label__1
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going bac __label__0
Owner's are really great people __label__1
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorfu __label__1
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt to __label__0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tast __label__1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fas __label__1
Fantastic service her __label__1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possibl __label__0
They know how to make them her __label__1
very tough and very short on flavo __label__0
I hope this place sticks aroun __label__1
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap wate __label__0
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boo __label__1
The seafood was fresh and generous in portio __label__1
Plus, it's only 8 buck __label__1
The service was not up to par, eithe __label__0
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each tim __label__1
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ag __label__1
You cant go wrong with any of the food her __label__1
The chefs were friendly and did a good jo __label__1
I liked the patio and the service was outstandin __label__1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVO __label__1
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that agai __label__0
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointe __label__1
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restauran __label__0
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizz __label__1
Great Pizza and Salad __label__1
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at hom __label__0
This place is amazin __label__1
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later di __label__0
Just don't know why they were so slo __label__0
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selectio __label__1
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo deliciou __label__1
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with car __label__1
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a revie __label__0
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth i __label__1
Never again will I be dining at this plac __label__0
The food was excellent and service was very goo __label__1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selectio __label__1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodle __label__0

As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never retur __label__0
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightfu __label__1
Fantastic foo __label__1
Never going bac __label__0
The bus boy on the other hand was so rud __label__0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly know __label__0
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old way __label__1
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wron __label__1
The only downside is the servic __label__0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever ha __label__0
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing mea __label__1
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!! __label__1
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREA __label__1
You won't be disappointe __label__1
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very goo __label__1
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.0 __label__0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of sala __label__0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupon __label__0
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went bac __label__1
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmospher __label__1
I love this plac __label__1
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointe __label__0
OMG, the food was delicios __label__1
There is nothing authentic about this plac __label__0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoeve __label__0
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Tha __label__1
It's worth driving up from Tucso __label__1
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was non __label__0
Pretty good beer selection to __label__1
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTE __label__1
5 stars for the brick oven bread ap __label__1
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was deliciou __label__1
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and lef __label__0

Everyone is treated equally specia __label__1
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and egg __label__0
It was delicious! __label__1
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vega __label__0
As always the evening was wonderful and the food deliciou __label__1
Best fish I've ever had in my lif __label__1
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAN __label__0
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever taste __label__1
Pretty cool I would sa __label__1
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buyin __label__0
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't foo __label__0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewar __label__0
He deserves 5 star __label__1
They dropped more than the bal __label__0
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortabl __label__1
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love i __label__1
And the beans and rice were mediocre at bes __label__0
Best tacos in town by far __label__1
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMEN __label__0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minute __label__0
I won't be bac __label__0
They have great dinner __label__1
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibu __label__1
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starvin __label__0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vega __label__1
This is a disgrac __label__0
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area  __label__1
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been grea __label__1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Ari __label__1
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispense __label__1
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like i __label__0
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddo __label__1
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to se __label__1
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccabl __label__1
This one is simply a disappointmen __label__0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Boucho __label__0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwe __label__0
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Are __label__1
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possibl __label__1

TOTAL WASTE OF TIM __label__0
For service, I give them no star __label__0
I can assure you that you won't be disappointe __label__1
I can take a little bad service but the food suck __label__0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore __label__0
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regula __label__1
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the en __label__1
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and tast __label__1
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poo __label__0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the websit __label__0
What a mistake that wa __label__0
No complaint __label__1
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topi __label__1

Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so deliciou __label__1
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winne __label__1
Sauce was tasteles __label__0
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soo __label__0
Food was so goood __label__1
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad foo __label__0

This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoin __label__1

Don't waste your time her __label__0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffe __label__0
We enjoy their pizza and brunc __label__1
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooke __label__1
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifull __label__1
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living her __label__1
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fres __label__0
The selection of food was not the bes __label__0
Delicious and I will absolutely be bac __label__1
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishmen __label__1
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffl __label__1

It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sig __label__0
How awesome is tha __label__1
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name calling __label__0

The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problem __label__1
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simpl __label__0
A Disappointmen __label__0
Its not user friendl __label__0
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respec __label__0
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same proble __label__0
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mut __label__0
This PDA rock __label__1

the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phon __label__0
Poor produc __label__0
However I needed some better instruction __label__0
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software design __label__0
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver __label__1
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pac __label__0
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers __label__1
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price poin __label__0
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long hau __label__1
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phon __label__0
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ea __label__0

You get what you pay for I gues __label__0
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about i __label__1
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me u __label__0
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellen __label__1
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacture __label__0
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the cal __label__0
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have trie __label__1
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones ar __label__1
Great phon __label__1
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the side __label__0
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ea __label__0
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not wor __label__0
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is grea __label__1
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the viso __label__0

I love the ringtones because they are so upbea __label__1
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cel __label__1

I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty wel __label__1
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfas __label__0
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clip __label__1
It doesn't make you look coo __label__0
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at al __label__1
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire da __label__1
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Playe __label__0
So just bewar __label__0
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my P __label__1
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversatio __label__0
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched u __label__1

The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replace __label__0
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owne __label__1
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc __label__0
It was a great phon __label__1
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my han __label__1
